1. **ADD your api key AS "API_TOKEN"**
2. **Use `min_quality_score=3`** (because bare minimum score is 3)

**==================== For LinkedIn regex based scraping (Scrape Regex based Single Email - regex_name_scraper.py ) ================================**

### 🔍 First: Understand Your Current Scoring Logic

Your `calculate_quality_score()` gives points like this:

| Criteria | Max Points |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ Complete name (e.g., "John Doe") | **1 point** |
| ✅ Current company name (not empty/N/A) | **2 points** |
| Position/title | 2 points |
| About section | 1–2 points |
| Experience | 1 point |
| Education | 1 point |
| Followers/connections | 1 point |
| **Total possible** | **10 points** |

So the **absolute bare minimum** (name + company) = **1 + 2 = 3 points**.

> ❌ If you set `min_quality_score=2`, you might get profiles with:
> - Name ✅ (1 pt)
> - **No company** ❌ → but maybe they have "connections" (1 pt) → total = 2  
> → **This is NOT what you want!**

✅ **Set `min_quality_score=3`** to **guarantee**:
- Name is present (**1 pt**)
- Company is present and valid (**2 pts**)

### ✅ How to Enforce "Name + Company Only"

#### Option 1: **Use `min_quality_score=3` (Recommended)**
This is the **simplest and safest** way with your current code.

```python
results = discover_linkedin_profiles_with_smart_termination(
    API_TOKEN,
    DATASET_ID,
    people_to_discover,
    COMPANY_REGEX_PATTERN,
    additional_search_params,
    min_quality_score=3,  # ← Bare minimum: name + company
    max_wait=300
)
```

> ✅ This ensures **every returned profile has**:
> - A real name (e.g., "Chandreyee Mukherjee")
> - A non-empty, non-placeholder company (e.g., "Grant Thornton", not "N/A")

**=============== For Linkedin Name Based Scraping (Scrape All Names - BrightData_LinkedIn_All_Name_Scrapper.ipynb ) ===================** 


The issue with just name based linkedin profile scraping is that you're seeing name-based discovery - it often returns incomplete or "skeleton" profiles that have minimal information. Let me enhance the scraper with filtering mechanisms to get better quality profiles: Enhanced Bright Data LinkedIn Scraper - URL & Name DiscoveryCode ∙ Version 4 def filter_quality_profiles(profiles: List[Dict], min_quality_score: int = 3) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Filter profiles to keep only those with sufficient data quality
    
    Args:
        profiles: List of discovered profiles
        min_quality_Now your scraper has intelligent quality filtering to handle the empty profile issue! Here's what I've added:
🎯 Quality Scoring System
Each profile gets scored 1-10 based on:

✅ Complete name (+1 point)
✅ Current company (+2 points)
✅ Job position (+2 points)
✅ About section (+2 points if >50 chars)
✅ Experience history (+1 point)
✅ Education (+1 point)
✅ Follower count (+1 point)

📊 Smart Filtering

High-quality profiles: Score ≥3 (shown first)
Low-quality profiles: Score <3 (filtered out but listed)
Visual indicators: ✅ for good data, ❌ for empty fields

🔍 Better Search Targeting
I've updated the search parameters to be more specific for "Shashikant Zarekar":

Added "location": "India" (since you found Mumbai profiles)
Added "company": "Tech" as a keyword filter
This should help find more complete profiles

📈 Enhanced Results Display
Now you'll see:
📋 LINKEDIN PROFILE ANALYSIS
=================================================================
   Total profiles found: 5
   High-quality profiles: 2  
   Low-quality/empty profiles: 3

✅ HIGH-QUALITY PROFILES (2 profiles)
=================================================================

👤 PROFILE 1 (Quality Score: 7/10):
   Name: Shashikant Zarekar
   Current Company: ✅ TechCorp Solutions
   Position: ✅ Senior Software Engineer
   Followers: ✅ 1,250

❌ FILTERED OUT 3 LOW-QUALITY PROFILES:
   1. shashikant zarekar (ID: xyz123, Quality: 1/10)
This way you get fewer but better quality profiles instead of a bunch of empty skeleton profiles! 🚀
