**==================== For LinkedIn regex based scraping (Scrape Regex based Single Email - Regex_based_single_email.ipynb ) ================================**
Current Behavior (Default):
Returns ALL profiles that match your company regex pattern
In your example, it would return every "Chandreyee Mukherjee" who currently works at or previously worked at any company containing "Grant"

**New Option - Select Best Match Only:**
Set select_best_only=True in the main function to get only the single best match based on these criteria:
Selection Criteria Options:

"comprehensive" (default) - Multi-factor scoring:

+50 points: Currently works at matching company (highest priority)
+2 per experience: More experience entries = higher score
+10 points: Has detailed "about" section (>100 characters)
+15 points: High connection count (>100 connections)
+10 points: High follower count (>500 followers)

"current_company" - Prioritizes profiles currently working at the matching company
"highest_quality" - Uses your existing quality scoring system

Key Point:
The Bright Data API itself cannot be stopped early - it runs the complete discovery process. The selection happens after all results are downloaded and filtered. This is because:

The API doesn't know which profiles will match your regex pattern
We need to see all matches to determine the "best" one
The API charges per job, not per result, so getting all results doesn't cost extra

Recommendation:
If you want only the best match for "Chandreyee Mukherjee" at any "Grant" company, set select_best_only=True. The algorithm will prioritize someone currently working at a Grant company over someone who previously worked there.
Would you like me to modify the selection criteria or add different scoring logic?

**=============== For Linkedin Name Based Scraping (Scrape All Names - BrightData_LinkedIn_All_Name_Scrapper.ipynb ) ===================**

The issue with just name based linkedin profile scraping is that you're seeing name-based discovery - it often returns incomplete or "skeleton" profiles that have minimal information. Let me enhance the scraper with filtering mechanisms to get better quality profiles: Enhanced Bright Data LinkedIn Scraper - URL & Name DiscoveryCode ∙ Version 4 def filter_quality_profiles(profiles: List[Dict], min_quality_score: int = 3) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Filter profiles to keep only those with sufficient data quality
    
    Args:
        profiles: List of discovered profiles
        min_quality_Now your scraper has intelligent quality filtering to handle the empty profile issue! Here's what I've added:
🎯 Quality Scoring System
Each profile gets scored 1-10 based on:

✅ Complete name (+1 point)
✅ Current company (+2 points)
✅ Job position (+2 points)
✅ About section (+2 points if >50 chars)
✅ Experience history (+1 point)
✅ Education (+1 point)
✅ Follower count (+1 point)

📊 Smart Filtering

High-quality profiles: Score ≥3 (shown first)
Low-quality profiles: Score <3 (filtered out but listed)
Visual indicators: ✅ for good data, ❌ for empty fields

🔍 Better Search Targeting
I've updated the search parameters to be more specific for "Shashikant Zarekar":

Added "location": "India" (since you found Mumbai profiles)
Added "company": "Tech" as a keyword filter
This should help find more complete profiles

📈 Enhanced Results Display
Now you'll see:
📋 LINKEDIN PROFILE ANALYSIS
=================================================================
   Total profiles found: 5
   High-quality profiles: 2  
   Low-quality/empty profiles: 3

✅ HIGH-QUALITY PROFILES (2 profiles)
=================================================================

👤 PROFILE 1 (Quality Score: 7/10):
   Name: Shashikant Zarekar
   Current Company: ✅ TechCorp Solutions
   Position: ✅ Senior Software Engineer
   Followers: ✅ 1,250

❌ FILTERED OUT 3 LOW-QUALITY PROFILES:
   1. shashikant zarekar (ID: xyz123, Quality: 1/10)
This way you get fewer but better quality profiles instead of a bunch of empty skeleton profiles! 🚀
