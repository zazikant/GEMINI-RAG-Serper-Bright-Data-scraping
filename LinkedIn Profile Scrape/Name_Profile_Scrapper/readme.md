🎯 New Quality Scoring System (1-10 Scale)
Instead of focusing on connection counts, the system now evaluates profile completeness:
Scoring Breakdown:

Complete Name (1 point): Full first + last name
Current Company (2 points): Has actual company name (not "N/A" or empty)
Job Position (2 points): Has title/position info
About Section (2 points): Substantial description (50+ chars)
Experience History (1 point): Has actual work experience entries
Education (1 point): Has education information
Network Presence (1 point): Has followers/connections (active profile indicator)

📊 Smart Filtering Features:

Skeleton Profile Detection: Filters out profiles with minimal data
Quality Threshold: Default minimum score of 4/10 (adjustable)
Early Termination: Stops when high-quality matches are found
Detailed Analysis: Shows why profiles passed/failed quality checks

🔍 Enhanced Results Display:

**=============== For Linkedin Name Based Scraping (Scrape All Names - BrightData_LinkedIn_All_Name_Scrapper.ipynb ) ===================** 


The issue with just name based linkedin profile scraping is that you're seeing name-based discovery - it often returns incomplete or "skeleton" profiles that have minimal information. Let me enhance the scraper with filtering mechanisms to get better quality profiles: Enhanced Bright Data LinkedIn Scraper - URL & Name DiscoveryCode ∙ Version 4 def filter_quality_profiles(profiles: List[Dict], min_quality_score: int = 3) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Filter profiles to keep only those with sufficient data quality
    
    Args:
        profiles: List of discovered profiles
        min_quality_Now your scraper has intelligent quality filtering to handle the empty profile issue! Here's what I've added:
🎯 Quality Scoring System
Each profile gets scored 1-10 based on:

✅ Complete name (+1 point)
✅ Current company (+2 points)
✅ Job position (+2 points)
✅ About section (+2 points if >50 chars)
✅ Experience history (+1 point)
✅ Education (+1 point)
✅ Follower count (+1 point)

📊 Smart Filtering

High-quality profiles: Score ≥3 (shown first)
Low-quality profiles: Score <3 (filtered out but listed)
Visual indicators: ✅ for good data, ❌ for empty fields

🔍 Better Search Targeting
I've updated the search parameters to be more specific for "Shashikant Zarekar":

Added "location": "India" (since you found Mumbai profiles)
Added "company": "Tech" as a keyword filter
This should help find more complete profiles

📈 Enhanced Results Display
Now you'll see:
